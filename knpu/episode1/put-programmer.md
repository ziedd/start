# PUT is for Updating

Suppose now that someone using our API needs to *edit* a programmer: maybe
they want to change its avatar. What HTTP method should we use? And what should 
the endpoint return? Answering those questions is one of the reasons we always 
start by writing a test - it's like the design phase of a feature.

Create a `public function testPUTProgrammer()` method:

[[[ code('a7fd55ca52') ]]]

*Usually*, if you want to edit a resource, you'll use the PUT HTTP method.
And so far, we've seen POST for creating and PUT for updating. But it's more
complicated than that, and involves PUT being idempotent. We have a full 5
minute video on this in our original REST screencast (see
[PUT versus POST](http://knpuniversity.com/screencast/rest/put-versus-post)),
and if you don't know the difference between PUT and POST, you should geek
out on this.

Inside the test, copy the `createProgrammer()` for CowboyCoder from earlier.
Yep, this programmer definitely needs his avatar changed. Next copy the request
and assert stuff from `testGETProgrammer()` and add that. Ok, what needs
to be updated. Change the request from `get()` to `put()`. And like earlier,
we need to send a JSON string `body` in the request. Grab one of the `$data`
arrays from earlier, add it here, then `json_encode()` it for the body. This
is a combination of stuff we've already done:

[[[ code('2ea197b91b') ]]]

For a PUT request, you're supposed to send the *entire* resource in the body,
even if you only want to update one field. So we need to send `nickname`,
`avatarNumber` *and* `tagLine`. Update the `$data` array so the `nickname`
matches `CowboyCoder`, but change the `avatarNumber` to 2. We won't update
the `tagLine`, so send `foo` and add that to `createProgrammer()` to make
sure this is CowboyCoder's starting `tagLine`:

[[[ code('25591ea067') ]]]

This will create the Programmer in the database then send a PUT request where
only the `avatarNumber` is different. Asserting a 200 status code is perfect, and
like most endpoints, we'll return the JSON programmer. But, we're already
testing the JSON pretty well in other spots. So here, just do a sanity check: assert
that the `avatarNumber` has in fact changed to 2:

[[[ code('f0fe136d49') ]]]

Ready? Try it out, with a `--filter testPUTProgrammer` to only run *this*
one:

```bash
phpunit -c app --filter testPUTProgrammer
```

Hey, a 405 error! Method not allowed. That makes perfect sense: we haven't
added this endpoint yet. Test check! Let's code!

## Adding the PUT Controller

Add a `public function updateAction()`. The start of this will look a lot
like `showAction()`, so copy its Route stuff, but change the method to `PUT`,
and change the name so it's unique. For arguments, add `$nickname` and also
`$request`, because we'll need that in a second:

[[[ code('945fee7f14') ]]]

Ok, we have two easy jobs: query for the `Programmer` then update it from
the JSON. Steal the query logic from `showAction()`:

[[[ code('2c414fe811') ]]]

The updating part is something we did in the original POST endpoint. Steal
*everything* from `newAction()`, though we don't need all of it. Yes yes,
we *will* have some code duplication for a bit. Just trust me - we'll reorganize
things over time. Get rid of the `new Programmer()` line - we're querying
for one. And take out the `setUser()` code too: that's just needed on create.
And because we're not creating a resource, we don't need the `Location` header
and the status code should be 200, not 201:

[[[ code('4d8ec4b0c5') ]]]

Done! And if you look at the function, it's really simple. Most of the duplication
is for pretty mundane code, like creating a form and saving the `Programmer`.
Creating endpoints is already really easy.

Before I congratulate us any more, let's give this a try:

```bash
phpunit -c app --filter testPUTProgrammer
```

Uh oh! 404! But check out that really clear error message from the response:

    No programmer found for username UnitTester

Well yea! Because we should be editing CowboyCoder. In `ProgrammerControllerTest`,
I made a copy-pasta error! Update the PUT URL to be `/api/programmers/CowboyCoder`,
not `UnitTester`:

[[[ code('3242209be5') ]]]

Now we're ready again:

```bash
phpunit -c app --filter testPUTProgrammer
```

We're passing!

## Centralizing Form Data Processing

Before we go on we need to clean up some of this duplication. It's small, 
but each write endpoint is processing the request body in the same way: by 
fetching the content from the request, calling `json_decode()` on that, then 
passing it to `$form->submit()`.

Create a new private function called `processForm()`. This will have two
arguments - `$request` and the form object, which is a `FormInterface` instance,
not that that's too important:

[[[ code('cc047a0d41') ]]]

We'll move two things here: the two lines that read and decode the request
body and the `$form->submit()` line:

[[[ code('8ac1472c14') ]]]

If this looks small to you, it is! But centralizing the `json_decode()` means
we'll be able to handle invalid JSON in one spot, really easily in the next
episode.

In `updateAction()`, call `$this->processForm()` passing it the `$request`
and the `$form`. Celebrate by removing the `json_decode` lines. Do the same
thing up in `newAction`:

[[[ code('8928a1e494') ]]]

Yay! We're just a little cleaner. To really congratulate ourselves, try the whole test suite:

```bash
phpunit -c app
```
Wow!
