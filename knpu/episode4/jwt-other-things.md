# JWT: Other Things to Think about

Mostly, that's it! JWT authentication is pretty cool: create an endpoint
to *fetch* a token and an authenticator to check if that token is valid. With the
error handling we added, this is a *really* robust system.

But, there are a few other things I want you to think about: things that *you* may
want to consider for your situation.

## Adding Scopes/Roles to the Token

First, when we created our JWT, we put the username inside of it:

[[[ code('2006d0742f') ]]]

Later, we used that to query for the User object:

[[[ code('5c59d225ae') ]]]

But, you can put *any* information in your token. In fact, you could also include
"scopes" - or "roles" to use a more Symfony-ish word - inside your token. Also,
nobody is forcing your authenticator to load a user from the database. To get really
crazy, you could decode the token and create some new, non-entity `User` object,
and populate it entirely from the information inside of that token.

And really, not everyone issues tokens that are related to a specific user in their
system. Sometimes, tokens are more like a package of permissions that describe what
an API client can and can't do. This is a *powerful* idea.

## OAuth versus JWT

And what about OAuth? If you've watched our [OAuth tutorial][1],
then you remember that OAuth is just a mechanism for securely delivering a token
to an API client. You may or may not need OAuth for your app, but if you *do* use
it, you still have the option to use JSON web tokens as your bearer, or access tokens.
It's not an OAuth versus JWT thing: each accomplishes different goals.

## Refresh Tokens

Finally, let's talk refresh tokens. In our app, we gave our tokens a lifetime of
1 hour:

[[[ code('164a29bcbd') ]]]

You see, JWT's aren't supposed to last forever. If you need them to, you
might choose to issue a refresh token along with your normal access token. Then
later, an API client could send the refresh token to the server and exchange it for
a new JWT access token. Implementing this is pretty easy: it involves creating an
extra token and an endpoint for exchanging it later. Auth0 - a leader in JWT - has
a nice [blog post][2] about it.

Ok! If you have any questions, let me know. I know this stuff can be crazy confusing!
Do your best to not overcomplicate things.

And as always, I'll see you guys next time.
