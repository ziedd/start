# Graceful Errors for an Invalid JWT

We already know that if the client *forgets* to send a token, Symfony calls the
`start()` method:

[[[ code('9d6d2f2c53') ]]]

But what happens if authentication fails?

## Testing with a bad Token

Let's find out! Copy `testRequiresAuthentication()`, paste it, and rename it to
`testBadToken()`:

[[[ code('f30751ac6b') ]]]

In this case, we *will* add a `headers` key and we *will* send an `Authorization` header...
but set to `Bearer WRONG`.

If this happens, we definitely want a 401 status code and - like always - an
`application/problem+json` response header. Let's *just* look for these two things
for now.

## How Authentication Fails

When JWT authentication fails, what handles that? Well, `onAuthenticationFailure()`
of course:

[[[ code('ed2903e70d') ]]]

The `getUser()` method *must* return a `User` object. If it doesn't, then `onAuthenticationFailure()`
is called. In our case, there are two possible reasons: the token might be corrupted
or expired *or* - somehow -  the decoded username doesn't exist in our database.
In both cases, we are *not* returning a User object, and this triggers `onAuthenticationFailure()`.

To start, just return a new `JsonResponse` that says `Hello`, but with the proper 401
status code:

[[[ code('cf6cfa79c8') ]]]

Copy the `testBadToken` method name and give it a try!

```bash
./vendor/bin/phpunit --filter testBadToken
```

## ApiProblem on Failure

It *almost* works - that's a good start. It proves our code in `onAuthenticationFailure()`
is handling things. Now, let's setup a proper API problem response, just like we
did before: `$apiProblem = new ApiProblem` with a 401 status code:

[[[ code('b03bfe16c5') ]]]

Then, use `$apiProblem->set()` to add a `detail` field. And in this case, we *always* have
an `AuthenticationException` that can hint what went wrong. Use its `getMessageKey()`
method:

[[[ code('ed7557384b') ]]]

Oh, and by the way - if you want, you can send this through the `translator` service
and translate into multiple languages.

Finish this with `return $thisâ€“>responseFactory->createResponse()` to turn the
`$apiProblem` into a nice JSON response:

[[[ code('9f2c502648') ]]]

That's it! We did all the hard work earlier.

I want to actually *see* how this response looks. So, add a `$this->debugResponse()`
at the end of `testBadToken()`:

[[[ code('9a51703f38') ]]]

Now, re-run the test!

```bash
./vendor/bin/phpunit --filter testBadToken
```

Check that out - it's beautiful! It has all the fields it needs, including `detail`,
which is set to `Invalid token`.

## Controlling Error Message

That text is coming from *our* code, when we throw the `CustomUserMessageAuthenticationException`.
The text - `Invalid token` - becomes the "message key" and this exception is passed
to `onAuthenticationFailure()`.

This gives you complete control over how your errors look.
